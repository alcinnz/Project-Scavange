# Project-Scavange
The goal: Encourage the success of search engines targetted to specific domains, over *the one searchbox to rule them all* (as in **Google**, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yacy, etc). 

Being targetted to a specific domain means any application can provide better experience for that specific task than one that provides a mediocre experience for all tasks.
