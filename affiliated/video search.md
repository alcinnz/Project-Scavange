**NOTE** This is not a core component of Project Scavange, but it would help me to test out the experience Project Scavange lends to "gatherers".

While domain-specific search engines of all sorts are necessary to make Project Scavange shine, one that's of personal interest would find me movies to watch. Specifically I will address the following needs with this search engine:

* My need to find DRM-free (though not necessarily $0) movies to enjoy, and reward them for this stand.
* Independent movie maker's needs to be promoted
* The more mainstream need to find movies amongst Hollywood's exclusive deals with distribution sites.

My promotion strategy would be based in part on [The Humble Bundle](https://humblebundle.com/), with their mix of indie/DRM-free titles with fewer mainstream titles. It's in this strategy that the last bullet point fits into this service. 

## Contents
This search engine will try to include all TV-quality videos accessible through the Web. It will not include:

1. Unauthorized download links for any movie still under copyright.
2. Movies without a strog narrative. 
3. Bad effects *may* disqualify a movie from being included. 

In part these are excluded because this content is too easy to find, but also because a) I want it easy to find movies many will enjoy, b) I don't want to be vilified as another "pirate site", & c) I'd rather people boycott movies if they disagree with it's DRM than "pirate" it. 

Public domain classics will be distributed for free (both as in speech and beer) via IPFS hosting, in an attempt to preserve cultural heritage. 

### Promoting DRM-free Stuff
While I strongly believe that DRM, and the laws which humour it, *should* have never existed, I am aware that most people simply don't care. At the same time I want to promote the DRM-free stuff both to share the joys of controlling your own viewing experience, and to strengthen the anti-DRM movement. At the sametime most people will look for mainstream/Hollywood movies and treat their presence as an indicator of quality. 

In short I will include DRM-encumbered media to draw people in, but promote DRM-free media to the top of the list. But then to make it clear that I have the movies people know and live, I'll partially invert this demotion for certain production companies. Specifically this promotion would involve moving one or two movies from those companies up into each page without that content. 

### Where Would I Source This Content?
Finding movies to include on this site is tricky. Much of the content I want would be (rightfully) behind paywalls, and hardly anyone would bookmark individual movies let alone sharing those bookmarks with me. Those that purchase DRM-free stuff would visit the movie's site, fill out a payment form, and download the movie into a "Videos" folder &mdash; it's quite an ephemeral visit. And those who purchase DRM-encumbered (which I'm less interested in) stuff would bookmark a streaming site like Netflix rather than the movies on it.

On the other-hand many but not nearly all DRM-free videos (including some very mainstream ones) are published to Vimeo Ondemand or Vimeo OTT/vhx.tv. And the Internet Archive contains many public domain classics. Then ofcourse Blender's work must be included and the Defective By Design campaign are aware of other smaller sources I could use. Beyond that I'm stumped.

What I do know however is that I would have to curate the collection to cull the low-quality items.
