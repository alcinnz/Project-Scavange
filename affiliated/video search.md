**NOTE** This is not a core component of Project Scavange, but it would help me to test out the experience Project Scavange lends to "gatherers".

While domain-specific search engines of all sorts are necessary to make Project Scavange shine, one that's of personal interest would find me movies to watch. Specifically I will address the following needs with this search engine:

* My need to find DRM-free (though not necessarily $0) movies to enjoy, and reward them for this stand.
* Independent movie maker's needs to be promoted
* The more mainstream need to find movies amongst Hollywood's exclusive deals with distribution sites.

My promotion strategy would be based in part on [The Humble Bundle](https://humblebundle.com/), with their mix of indie/DRM-free titles with fewer mainstream titles. It's in this strategy that the last bullet point fits into this service.
