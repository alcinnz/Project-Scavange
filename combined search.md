# Combined Search
Browsers like Firefox and Opera have recently made strides in encouraging the use of different search engines for different purposes. However they reasonably don't want to require users to select a search engine before hitting `enter`, so they need to choose a default one to use in that case. 

While I don't want to force the selection of a search engine either this copout still puts pressure on users to select a default search engine and to use it predominantly. This won't do for project Scavange, so instead we'll fetch the results from all the registered search engines and merge sort them into a single display, with proper credit given.
