Odysseus is a new WebKit-based web browser I'm developing to:

* Better fit in with my preferred desktop, elementary OS Pantheon.
* Try out the Project Scavange experience I want to test. 

While it's developed specifically for GNOME-based desktops, particularly Pantheon, it should work fine elsewhere. It just might not seem as special as it would to fans of elementary OS. 

These two purposes are complementary as targetting elementary OS gives me an audience more willing to try out Project Scavange, and Project Scavange allows me to better adhear to elementary's guidelines.

I have no problem with new or established browsers also incorporating features from Odysseus. In fact I actually want them to "steal" the features associated with Project Scavange (i.e. described in this repository).
